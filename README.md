## Intro
This project was created on December of 2022, for the university course Databases at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh).

## Part A
An application that requires database management should be selected, and the logical design of the database should be done according to the relational model. The logical design includes:

1. Description of the application and its data requirements.
2. User categories and their requirements for database access, input, and output of data.
3. Definition of entities and relationships of the database and the entity-relationship diagram.
4. Logical design of the schema, specifying data definition fields, relationships, integrity constraints, and various perspectives. For each data definition field, specify the data type (integer, alphanumeric 30 characters, date, etc.). For each relationship, specify attributes, primary key(s), and make an estimate of the table size (number of rows). Show the relationships for each perspective.
5. Examples of tables with 5-10 rows of real or artificial data.
6. Examples of queries or query classes that can be answered by the schema you will design. Provide at least one example for each operation, with an emphasis on projection, selection, and join operations.
